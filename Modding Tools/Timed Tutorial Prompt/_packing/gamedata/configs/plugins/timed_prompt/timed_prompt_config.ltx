[enabled_prompts]
; Add the NPE set IDs here for any tutorials that should prompt the player first,
; if you want NPE to handle this rather than triggering the prompt yourself. This 
; can also be done at runtime:

; z_npe_timed_prompt.enable_tutorial_ask_prompt(set_id, args)

; Note that you can't set a table of args in this file, that must be done at 
; runtime using the above function.

[default_settings]
; These can be DLTX'd as necessary to set different defaults.
default_ui_file 		= ui_timed_prompt.xml
disable_all_sounds 		= false
; Does exactly what it says
icons_for_keys 			= true
; If an special icon is available for a keybind (like the mouse buttons), use it
mark_missed_as_played 	= false
; If a tutorial times out without a response from the player, mark it as played in NPE
; Defaults to false because the player might not have even noticed a timed-out tutorial,
; so we want to give them another chance at it.
mark_passed_as_played 	= true
; If they dismiss the tutorial prompt with a keypress, however, we assume that means
; they don't want to see it again, and mark it as played.
show_timer_indicator 	= true
; Shows a circular indicator to display how close the window is to timing out.
attach_timer_to_title 	= true
; The timer indicator's anchor point will be relative to the end of the title, however long it is
show_timeout_reminder	= true
; If enabled, tutorials that are missed because they timed out will have a brief window
; shown after, reminding the player where they can mark or unmark tutorials in MCM.

# **MCM UI FUNCTORS**

This monkeypatch is now deprecated, as MCM now includes this functionality in its latest version. Please don't use it for anything other than informational purposes.

It was designed to disable itself if it detects MCM support, so if it appears in your installation you can either delete the script or ignore it.

# Adaptive Marker System for Tactical Compass
A work-in-progress rewrite and overhaul of the Tactical Compass addon, enhancing it with markers that automatically support any mapspot that can appear in the game, including those from other addons. 

Requires the latest modded exes from demonized:

For now, load the AMS *after* the original Tactical Compass, which you can get here:

## This addon is a work in progress. It is not even remotely ready for public release, and is here for others to try out and help me test. Feel free to download the latest build from this folder, but expect bugs and potential instability, and no particular timeline for when there will be updates.

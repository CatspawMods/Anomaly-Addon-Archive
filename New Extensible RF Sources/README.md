# New Extensible RF Sources
Moddb: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/new-extensible-rf-sources

A stripped-down "embedded" version of NERFS is used with permission in [Devices of Anomaly Redone](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/devices-of-anomaly-redone), but you will get a much richer set of features by downloading the latest version of NERFS from here or Moddb, and loading it after DAR.

I also recommend using the latest modded exes from demonized:

https://github.com/themrdemonized/STALKER-Anomaly-modded-exes

They contain advanced features that many new addons require, and other improvements that nearly make Anomaly a new game. They are, for example, required in order for scripts to access the mouse wheel, which NERFS then allows you to use to tune the frequency of the RF Receiver.

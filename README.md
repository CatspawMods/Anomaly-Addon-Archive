# Anomaly-Addon-Archive
This is a version archive and general code repository for any Stalker: Anomaly mods made by Catspaw. 

# Terms of use

1. Feel free to use anything you find here for noncommercial purposes in your own addons, including using any bits of code in your own scripts.

2. Generally speaking, please DO NOT include modified versions of the same files in your own addons.

In other words, if I have a file called utils_catsy_common.script, you're free to include it in your own addon, unmodified. You're also free to take code from it, and use that code in your own scripts that are named something else. What I don't want you doing is modifying utils_catsy_common.script (or anything else) and then including a modified copy of that same file in some other addon or modpack.

# Troubleshooting

If you are encountering an unsolvable issue with the most recent version of any of my addons, you can download one of the versions here to see if that works better.

I cannot provide ANY support whatsoever for any issues encountered with any previous version of any of my mods, or any of the random code found only here--only the most recent releases of addons that are posted on Moddb.

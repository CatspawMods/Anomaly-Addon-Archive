# **Catspaw's Anomaly Addon Archive**
This is a version archive and general code repository for any [Stalker: Anomaly mods made by Catspaw](https://www.moddb.com/members/catspawmods/addons). 

# Terms of use

1. Feel free to use anything you find here for noncommercial purposes in your own addons, including using any bits of code in your own scripts.
2. Generally speaking, please DO NOT include modified versions of the same files in your own addons.
3. **ALL CONTENT FOUND HERE IS USED AT YOUR OWN RISK.** I can't provide any support at all for what you find here, period.

In other words, if I have a file called `utils_catsy_common.script`, you're free to include it in your own addon, unmodified. You're also free to take code from it, and use that code in your own scripts that are named something else. What I don't want you doing is modifying `utils_catsy_common.script` (or anything else) and then including a modified copy of that same file in some other addon or modpack.

Do you want ugly mod conflicts? Because that's how you get ugly mod conflicts. Don't do it, please.

# Troubleshooting

If you are encountering an unsolvable issue with the most recent version of any of my addons, you can download one of the versions here to see if that works better.

As mentioned above, I cannot provide ANY assistance with any previous version of any of my mods, or for any of the random code found only here--only for the most recent releases of addons that are posted on Moddb.

This archive sometimes lags behind Moddb for updates, so always check Moddb first for the latest versions of any released addons: https://www.moddb.com/members/catspawmods/addons

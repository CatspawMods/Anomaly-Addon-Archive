If you are **not** using modded exes, and therefore cannot use version 1.1 of the Barrier Defense Task Emission Fix, then use 1.0 instead.

Version 1.1 is more compatible with other addons because it doesn't replace `tasks_defense.script`, but it requires the unlocalizer feature in modded exes.

You should be using modded exes anyway. There is absolutely no good reason to use the vanilla binaries unless you are looking for a the purest vanilla experience, with no bugfixes or pretty shaders.

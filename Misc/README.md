If you are using the most recent version of Anomaly, then you no longer need the Barrier Defense Task Emission Fix addon--that fix is included in Anomaly 1.5.3. You should be running the latest version no matter what, and I recommend using the latest modded exes from demonized:

https://github.com/themrdemonized/STALKER-Anomaly-modded-exes

They contain advanced features that many new addons require, and other improvements that nearly make Anomaly a new game.

The rest are other simple one-off addons that didn't require their own folder. Most are essentially complete and will receive no further updates, though I need to look into reports that Actor Hit Effects isn't working anymore.

You can find more information on their individual Moddb pages here: https://www.moddb.com/members/catspawmods/addons
